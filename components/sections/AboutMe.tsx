  ðŸ‘‹ <b>Namaste! I'm Vinit, an AI/ML Developer</b> who spends his time teaching machines to understand language, process data, and occasionally guess what I want for dinner (*still in beta*). My love for math was inevitable, thanks to my <b>math-genius mother</b>, who ensured I could solve equations before I could spell "algorithm."
</p>

<p>
  <FaCode className="inline-block mr-2" /> 
  After <b>two years of wrestling with data</b> as a research engineer, I took a deep dive into the world of AI. Teaching <b>Transform Calculus</b> in academia was a revelationâ€”it turns out <b>programming and math</b> aren't just cousins; they're practically Bollywood siblings separated at birth. This realization led me straight into the fascinating world of <b>Machine Learning, NLP, and LLMs</b>.
</p>

<p>
  When I'm not debugging models or explaining AI concepts with funny analogies, you might find me:
</p>

<ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
  <li><FaPizzaSlice className="inline-block mr-2" /> Experimenting with the <b>perfect panner-to-butter ratio</b> (because hyperparameter tuning applies to spices too).</li>
  <li><FaHiking className="inline-block mr-2" /> Trekking in the <b>Western Ghats</b> (and proving that getting lost is just an <b>unsupervised learning task</b>).</li>
  <li><FaPuzzlePiece className="inline-block mr-2" /> Solving puzzles, <b>both logical and why my WiFi stops working when I need it most</b>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Currently, I'm diving deeper into <b>LLMs, NLP, and AI Agents</b>, because who wouldn't want to build AI that actually understands humans? I believe in <b>lifelong learning, innovation</b>, and ensuring AI is as <b>useful, efficient, and maybe even funny</b> as possible. 
</p>

<p>
  So, if you ever need a conversation about <b>AI</b>, <b>or just want to debate the best street food in India</b>, let's connect! ðŸš€
